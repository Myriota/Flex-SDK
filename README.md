# Myriota Flex SDK

The Myriota FlexSense provides an off-the-shelf ready-to-go hardware
solution for IoT sensing and monitoring applications with Myriotaâ€™s
bi-directional, direct-to-orbit (D2O) satellite communications. The
Myriota Flex SDK provides users with the necessary boilerplate
to get started writing custom application firmware for the Myriota
FlexSense. See the full docs [here](https://flex-docs.myriota.com/)

## Development Environment Setup

Myriota currently only supports building the Flex SDK on a
system running Ubuntu 22.04 or using a
[DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
from within [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Myriota supports
programming of the FlexSense from any version of Linux, Windows and Mac
that support the installation of the 'python3.10' and it's corresponding
version of 'pip'.

### Setting Up Ubuntu 22.04 For Development

#### Install packages

Install these packages with apt:

```shell
sudo apt install \
  git \
  curl \
  xxd \
  meson \
  ninja-build \
  gcc \
  python3 \
  python3-pip \
  python-is-python3
```

>  [!TIP]
>  If you install these programs via other methods then make sure
>  they meet these version requirements:
>  - **meson >= 0.61.2**
>  - **ninja >= 1.10.1**
>  - **python >= 3.10.12**
>
>  You can ignore the gcc version as it is only installed as a
>  requirement of meson native builds, but not actually used in the cross
>  building process.

#### Install GNU ARM Toolchain

Myriota uses the GNU ARM Toolchain version 7.2.1 to compile user
applications for the Myriota FlexSense. Myriota hosts its own copy of
this toolchain and it can be installed in `/opt/gcc-arm/` with the command:

```shell
sudo ./scripts/install_arm_toolchain.sh
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must update your `PATH` variable to to include the toolchain. i.e.
> Add `export PATH="${PATH}:/opt/gcc-arm/bin"` to your `~/.profile` or
> wherever you configure your environment variables for your given
> shell.

#### Install Python Requirements

Install the correct python environment with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> For simplicity we install the python packages globally, but you
> can also use a python virtual environment. See
> [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
> for details.

### Downloading libflex and system_image binaries

The `libflex.a` and `system_image.bin` binaries must downloaded and installed
in the correct location, in order to perform a build. This can be
achieved by running the following command:

```shell
python scripts/download_binaries.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You require valid Myriota Device Manager credentials in order to
> download the binaries. The script will prompt you to supply them.

### Setting Up Windows For Development

To develop on windows you should first install
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). When you open the Flex SDK
 folder in VSCode it should direct you through the steps that
are requierd to setup your
[DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
Once you have the DevContainer open in a terminal you will be able to
perform the [build instruction](#building-the-user-application).


#### Install Python and Python Requirements

In order to program the FlexSense on windows you will need to install python
on your PC.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following commands should be all performed from within a Windows Terminal
> Shell (CMD or PowerShell).

Install python:

```powershell
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.10
```

Then navigate the Flex SDK projects root directory, and run the following:

```powershell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building The User Application

### 1. Setup
The following build instructions assume your current working directory
is the project root. Configure the build with the following command (this only
needs to be run once):

```shell
meson --cross-file ./flex-crossfile.ini build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to provide the `--cross-file ./flex-crossfile.ini` otherwise
> the build will fail.

#### Setup Options
##### 1. Skip GNSS
To assist development where a GPS signal is difficult to obtain, for example
an indoor environment, the Flex SDK provides the `skip_gnss` option.<br />
By default the `skip_gnss` option is disabled. To enable this option in the build,
simply add `-Dskip_gnss=true` in the setup step, before building:
```shell
meson -Dskip_gnss=true --cross-file ./flex-crossfile.ini build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During production builds, please validate that the `skip_gnss` option is
> disabled (set to false), to ensure correct operation of the FlexSense device.

### 2. Build
Then to perform the build simply run the command:

```shell
meson compile -C build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After building the source the compiled user application will be available
> under the `build/` directory as `user_application.bin`. You can also find
> compiled versions of examples under `build/examples/`.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the source code of the examples in the following
> directory `examples`.

### Pristine Build
To perform a pristine build, delete the `build` folder before running the
setup and build commands again.

## Programming The FlexSense

Programming a FlexSense device requires the flashing of two separate
images:

- System Image or 'system_image.bin'
- User Application or 'user_application.bin'

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The System Image only needs to be flashed once during development or on the
> release of a new Flex SDK. The User Application is what you
> will be developing so update it as you need. If you flash the System
> Image you must re-flash the User Application.

### Programming On Linux

The following programming instructions assume your current working directory
is the project root. To program the System Image run:

```shell
./scripts/updater.py -f ./subprojects/libflex/system_image/system_image-*.bin
```

To program the User Application:

```shell
./scripts/updater.py -m ./build/user_application.bin
```

### Programming On Windows

The following programming instructions assume your current working directory
is the project root. To program the System Image run:

```shell
python .\scripts\updater.py -f .\subprojects\libflex\system_image\system_image-*.bin
```

To program the User Application run:

```shell
python .\scripts\updater.py -m .\build\user_application.bin
```
